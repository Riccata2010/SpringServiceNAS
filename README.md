# SpringServiceNAS
Exploring SpringBoot, Angular and Bootstrap. With JPA and some AOP.

This simple project is an example of using SpringBoot, Angular and Bootstrap. With the complication of 
JPA and a brief mention of AOP (aspect oriented programming).


Two micro services are performed that communicate with each other with synchronous messages via AOP. 
One micro service takes care of saving information in an H2 db, while the other uploads files, 
typically photos and videos. There is also a third micro service used to present a simple angular web app to actually upload.
